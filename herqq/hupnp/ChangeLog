# HUPnP Changelog

HUPnP 0.4.0 [Mar. 4, 2010]
- Modified the design of state variables and their use. More specifically, the API is now clear 
that state variables can be changed directly only at server-side.

- Added the possibility of locking a writable state variable for exclusive access at server-side.

- Modified the design of action arguments. Input and output arguments are no longer separated at type-level.

- Removed exception usage from HTTP messaging. This was mainly because of a MinGW bug (http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2837096&group_id=2435&atid=102435), which essentially causes multi-threaded exception usage be unsafe. Please note, HUPnP still uses exceptions elsewhere, which means that with MinGW 4.4.0 HUPnP is subject to crashes. The HUPnP HTTP messaging used exceptions to signal timeouts, peer disconnects and such, which made the bug all too easy to appear in case multiple threads were simultaneously running their own HUPnP HTTP messaging "engines". This is the case with the simple HUPnP test app, which enables the launch of a HDeviceHost and multiple HControlPoints within the same process using separate threads.

- Modified the server-side action invocation mechanics when the invocations come over the network.

- Modified the example application to use the state variable locker, which fixes a race condition.

- Fixed a few errors in internal HTTP messaging code. These mainly affected action invocation and
event notification.

- Modified the internal asynch. HTTP handler code to support chunked encoding.

- Removed insulation from a few small classes that are unlikely to change.

- Some small optimizations here and there.

- Updated documentation.

- Many smaller improvements not worth mentioning individually.

HUPnP 0.3.0 [Feb. 17, 2010]
- Significant refactoring of the project, file and class structures.

- Added a simple example application to be distributed along with HUPnP. The example demonstrates basic
HUPnP usage.

- Reduced thread usage by utilizing the Qt's eventloop more.

- Removed exceptions from the public interface. This affected HDeviceInfo + several classes in the
SSDP "module".

- Removed the HCore and HUtils libraries and moved their code directly into the HUpnp library.

- Modified the action invocation semantics. This changed the HAction interface as well.

- Modified the HControlPoint interface.

- Modified the initialization of HSsdp. This also meant a change to the interface.

- Fixed several memory leaks and memory access errors.

- Improved logging by feeding more information to the messages.

- Updated documentation.

- Many smaller improvements not worth mentioning individually.

HUPnP 0.2.0 [Feb. 2, 2010]
- Significant refactoring of the project, file and class structures.

- Fixed several bugs relating to URL handling in HDeviceHost and HControlPoint.

- Changed action invocation on the control point side to use persistent sockets.

- Fixed a bug in HStateVariable, which caused "allowed value ranges" to be parsed improperly.

- Fixed a bug in HDeviceHost, which caused the HDeviceHost to announce wrong cache-control max-age timeouts.

- Fixed a bug in HDeviceHost, which in a certain scenario caused a failure in transmission of an event NOTIFY message.

- Added support for enabling/disabling warning logs that relate to non-standard behaviour discovered
in other UPnP software.

- Updated documentation.

- Several other improvements not worth mentioning individually.

Special thanks goes to Jochen Becher <jochen_becher at gmx.de> for testing the library and reporting
of his findings. Some of the above-mentioned bugs were discovered due to his efforts. In addition, he
suggested the possibility of disabling warnings that relate to non-standard behaviour discovered in
other UPnP software. Thank you!

HUPnP 0.1.1 [Jan. 26, 2010]

- Added support for chunked encoding.

- Fixed several deficiences relating to action invocation error handling.

- Fixed a bug in HControlPoint where the HTTP Host header field was not always sent in a GET request. 
  * This was found by Jochen Becher <jochen_becher at gmx.de>. Thanks!

- Fixed a bug in HDeviceHost, which forced description documents to reside in the current directory to be found.

- Removed exception usage from "simple" classes in Ssdp module.

- A few small improvements not worth mentioning individually.

- Updated documentation.

- Created this change log.
